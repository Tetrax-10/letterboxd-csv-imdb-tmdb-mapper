> [!CAUTION]
> When scraping CSVs that don't have direct film links eg: `diary.csv`, add `nocache` argument. Else the script will fail to scrape the CSV.

> ```bash
> npm run scrape "diary.csv" nocache
> ```

#### Additional arguments:

```bash
npm run scrape "watched.csv" -- imdb b10
```

-   `imdb`: IMDb format output
-   `b10`: convert rating to base 10
